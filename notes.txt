new logic:

run string search
if reached quality: make combo list with all combos from solution plus all "stringy" ones and run regular search with that
  and the solution as budget
  OR maybe
  try squeezing the solution around to spread the troops a bit (not sure)
else run regular search BUT if we can't reach more goals, keep the string solution



can't reach anything -> string
can reach level but string can't reach quality -> brute force lvl1, should be pretty fast
can reach level and quality with string -> additional brute force IF have extra troops? it definitely can be better

Sometimes string can't reach Q but brute can't reach level (although in some cases both can be reached)! -> Add "ignore quality" option? how to reach both?
50, 15, 5, 4, 8; 0, 1, 0, 120

50,4,10,3,10; 0,1,0,118

timeout doesnt work?
0,33,169,29,15,14; 20,2,0,216



- recheck label sizes on small screens

help:
how does refinement work?
how does saving treasure work?
how to improve performance?
are purses/rings worth using at the beginning?
- it IS possible to save some gold by starting off with some purses and rings, but it's never a significant amount
  (verify) unless you're low on high-value troops and are spending a lot of gold anyway. In such cases, waiting
  to get just a few genie's lamps or sacred treasures can save hundreds of thousands of gold.
only if you are low on higher-value troops.


maybe:
add quality upgrade percentage display for <100%
add "export link" with all values


Scrapped the "Save rare treasure" slider. I decided that it wasn't clear how it worked and it was too inconsistent to be really useful.
