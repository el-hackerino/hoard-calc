partial solutions:
- can't reach quality -> highest quality, then fewest gold (/troops?)
- can't reach level -> highest quality, then level (not level -> gold? better long-term; troops?)



balance gold - troops:

gold: minimize gold at any cost
always use best troops at end, don't care about exceeding 100%

troop: minimize good troop use (adapt to current amounts? to base frequeicy in portals? percentage of budget? allow in-between steps?)
same? middle ground? too weak? Never exceed 100% at expense of slower climb at end, lose some gold
