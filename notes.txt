skipping combos 0 and 1 after a few steps is a major perf boost. when to use it?
- high target levels need quick list anyway
- low level, low cost factor (0 only), sufficient high-level troops (determine amount empirically)
- also find bounds for low level and low cost factor empirically

slow but actually uses c and r: 100,70,20,10,5,1 0,1,0,110 (factor 1)

give up on refinement if it takes too long? Maybe just add a stop button?

2 scenarios: only care about 10/100 or want high levels and don't care about quality?

limit max budget for purses + coins unless going for a high level (where lo-fi is needed anyway)

idea: two stages of warnings - red when lo-fi, yellow when unfinished hi-fi

reevaluate troop cost factor values
scrap slider? why ever save troops? can limit budget manually -> sometimes adding sacred treasure is inefficient
alt: slider actually also increses purse/ring budget

idea for refinement: add combos to calc gradually until too slow

help:

how does refinement work?
how does saving treasure work?
how to improve performance?
are purses/rings worth using at the beginning?
- it IS possible to save some gold by starting off with some purses and rings, but it's never a significant amount
  (verify) unless you're low on high-value troops and are spending a lot of gold anyway. In such cases, waiting
  to get just a few genie's lamps or sacred treasures can save hundreds of thousands of gold.
only if you are low on higher-value troops.


verify:
- skipping combos 0+1 after a few steps (or just limiting the budget?) if enough better troops - formula?
- why first solution shown is alwazs some 3k 1step thing

check solution.troopCounts vs troopTotals
recheck large car width vs main div
