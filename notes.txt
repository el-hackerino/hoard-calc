partial solutions:
- can't reach quality -> highest quality, then fewest gold (/troops?)
- can't reach level -> highest quality, then level (not level -> gold? better long-term; troops?)

ADD ALL combos (even high %)


balance gold - troops:

gold: minimize gold at any cost
always use best troops at end, don't care about exceeding 100%

troop: minimize good troop use (adapt to current amounts? to base frequeicy in portals? percentage of budget? allow in-between steps?)
same? middle ground? too weak? Never exceed 100% at expense of slower climb at end, lose some gold



low prio:
Riskiness:
0%: never go below 100%
100%: allow 50%+?
