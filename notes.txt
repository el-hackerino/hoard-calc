Potential issue:
Sometimes string can't reach Q but brute can't reach level (although in some cases both can be reached)!
In these cases, reaching the level (keeping the quality) requires very suboptimal combos that we can't all include.
 -> Add "ignore quality" option? only for cases where we cant reach level?

Extreme case? file:///Users/admin/Misc/Code/hoard-master/index.html?0|20|19|33|37|50|1|1|0|200


Maybe:
- add quality upgrade percentage display for <100%
- can reach level but string can't reach quality -> brute force lvl1, should be pretty fast?
- better treasure is super valuable at high levels -> re-add slider or add some logic for saving?
- rework intermediate updates?

What's new:
Scrapped the "Save rare treasure" slider. I decided that it wasn't clear how it worked and it was too inconsistent to be really useful.
